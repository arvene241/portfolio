            Iâ€™m college student and currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in
            Computer Science from Batangas State University. My main focus these
            days is building responsive and beautiful looking web applications
            and learning modern technologies for the web. I mostly work on
            personal projects and sometimes on freelance projects.

              Right now you can find me working with React.js,
              Styled-Components, and in general anything HTML, Javascript, and
              CSS related. Also been studying how to use Redux, and my goal is
              to become MERN stack developer.
